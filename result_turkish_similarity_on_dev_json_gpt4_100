Ideally, to construct the SQL query, we would need information regarding the languages spoken in each city or country and we would also need to know which continents the countries belong to, which isn't available among the provided database schemas. However, assuming that the database schemas have been provided correctly, a corresponding SQL query based on the previous examples can't be provided. If you had a table for countries, cities, and countrylanguages, the correct SQL query might look something like this: SELECT DISTINCT city.Name FROM country JOIN city ON city.CountryCode = country.Code WHERE country.Continent = 'Europe' AND country.Code NOT IN (SELECT countrylanguage.CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T' AND countrylanguage.Language = 'English')
