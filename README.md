Data Mining


# To setup

1. Create a folder named spider locally, and download the spider dataset inside.
It should look like spider/dataset/tables.json
2. Checkout evaluator next to the dataset folder with name evaluator
```
cd spider
git clone git@github.com:taoyds/spider.git
```
It should look like spider/evaluator/evaluation.py
3. In your first run, evaluator will complain about a missing file and will tell what to do. Do it xd
